How to Build

kernel
======
1. Get the prebuilt cross compiler from AOSP website:
   $ git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.7

2. Copy required cross compiler to your alps folder:
    ex. ~/alps/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.7

3. Run the build command under your alps folder
   $ ./mk lr55 n k

output
======
1. When the build process is completed, the generated kernel can be found in the following path:
   alps/out/target/product/lr55

external
========
1. For building external projects, take the following commands as reference:
   $ mkdir ~/AOSP
   $ cd AOSP
2. Sync the corresponding codebase from Android website:
   $ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.4.2_r2
   $ repo sync
3. Copy all folders from external_src to ~/AOSP/external (replace the original folders):
   $ cp -r /PATH_TO/external_src/*  ~/AOSP/external/
   $ source build/envsetup.sh
   $ make
